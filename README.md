# Cloud Computing Project
**DRAFT**
We are writing a lightweight cloud storage deduplication program. Issues scalability, deduplication granularity and usefulness, and security will be addressed.

The front end is planned to be written in Qt (or Flutter), so that it can be used on mobile devices.

<!--## Group members-->

## Objective


Amazon EC2 instances are created on demand using the Boto3 library, depending on the input data size.

<!-- Grid computing: needs to stop other instances once the solution is found. -->
