As the name of PartialQL implies, it is 'partial' SQL, many feature from a 'full-fledged' SQL language is absent. Both does not support relational joins, because the databases are NoSQL key-value stores after all.



DynamoDB
In Amazon DynamoDB, you can use either the DynamoDB API, or PartiQL, a SQL-compatible query language, to query an item from a table.

PartiQL for DynamoDB
With PartiQL, you can perform a query by using the ExecuteStatement action and the Select statement on the partition key.

SELECT AlbumTitle, Year, Price
FROM Music
WHERE Artist='No One You Know' 
Using the SELECT statement in this way returns all the songs associated with this particular Artist.

For code examples using Select and ExecuteStatement, see PartiQL Select Statements for DynamoDB.
